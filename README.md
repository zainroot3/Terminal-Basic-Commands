# Who am I:
Hi, I am Zain, a student and learning cyber security to become a ethical Red Teamer.I am currently learning although I am not a beginner and I have lot of knowledge already but I want to start from beggining.
# Why:
Actually, I want to start from beginning because I don't have any proof or notes what I know and what I learned, So in this way I will upload my daily learnings in github and this will be a great proof that will be helpful for me, everything that I will learn and implement or create I will upload here with my own written notes.
I will not use AI to look like professional, I will write my own words even they are wrong does'nt matter to me because I want to learn not to show off.So, everything that I will write or upload will be my own written and I will do everything myself.
# From where I am learning:
I am student not able to buy premium courses or teachers, So I am learning from tryhackme.com and the lectures which are premium I will learn them from youtube. I am also learning from WS Cube CyberSecurity youtube channel.So, you can say I am learning from tryhackme.com and youtube and in future may be I will also use hackthebox and other labs also
# Why:
Because learning and writing notes,etc is not my goal and it not the main part.
The main part and my main purpose is to do practice on labs and make proof.
That's why I am using github so here I can upload what I learn and what I practice daily to make it useful to get a job.
# What's Today:
In today repositary I have practice basic commands of linux on my terminal and their use is also on notes and I will try to also share images of my practice in a separate folder or in the command page.
These are not all commands but it's enough to understand other commands we will understand time to time.
# What I know already that will help me:
Windows    -> 4 year experience

Linux      -> 2 year experience

C          -> 1 year experience

C++        -> 1 year experience (basics)

Python     -> learned recently

Networking -> I already learned advanced network scanning using nmap
