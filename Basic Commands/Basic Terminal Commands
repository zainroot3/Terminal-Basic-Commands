### What is Linux, Kernal and Terminal?

Actually everyone think both of above are same but there's some difference, most people don't have answer on linux is OS or kernal. 
But, correct is this that linux kernal and linux distrubations are separate.
In 1991 linux Torwals make linux kernal.

## Kernal

Kernal is Basically the black window to interact between hardware and sofware.
This is the black window, In which we can communicate or gave interactaion or you can say direct intruction sender to hardware.
As, linux Torwalds make this that's why people started it saying linux.
But, its just a black window to give instructions to hardware to perform tasks.
Linux Kernal is the core of Operating system to interact with hardware to perfrom tasks.

## Linux

Then time to time we created different softwares and human understandable languages.
Then we can command easily in human understandable language, this  language take commands from user and also send to kernal to perform task.
Time to time we collected kernal, sofwares and libraries and we found complete OS.
But, this OS called linux distrubation that also based on kernal.
Linux is free, open source operating system and it is easy to modify.
Linux is also community support distribution.
Linux is OS to manage softwares take commands from user and give to hardware and perform tasks.

## Terminal

To give instructions to kernal is easy language, that is understandable by humans, we use command line called terminal.
Terminal is the 3rd person between kernal and user that makes communication more easy.
Basically, terminal takes command from you give it to terminal, then terminal give commands to the hardware.

### Why Linux for Cyber Security?

Because, linux is open source in which we have full control and we can perfrom advanced tasks and we have many tools already.
All GUI not allowed us to perform advanced tasks like windows.
In linux we can perform advanced tasks and use all security tools here.
Linux have more control of hardware that's also a major reason of using linux.
It is easy to make automations here because linux is open source OS.

### File System of Linux

If we want to use linux for advance use,then it is important for us to understand its basic structure.
When we install linux, it creates a file system called partition called root location.

        ## Example
        
                   When we install windows in our PC it creates a partition called C drive, but linux does'nt create C drive it create root locaion.

## /

This is our root location, all files start from here.
This also store administator user.
In linux admin user known as root user.

## /home

All users and their directories store of all guest users.

## /usr

All user programs and their libraries store here.

## /bin, /sbin

It store binaries.
All system programs stored here.
It telles the system what to do on commands.
sbin is for OS tasks.

## /etc

It is the most important location.
All the configurations file stored here.

## /temp

All the temporary files stored here.
When we created a file temporary file of our file created here.
It is helpful when we undo and redo because our file is also stored here temporary.
When, we close our file our file deleted and if the file is not deleted, the file will be in this folder.

## /dev, /proc, /sys

These directories save all the device and system information.

## /var

It stores the logs of devices and data of all variables.

### Need of this file system

We know which file is for this if we want any data we know here it will be .
So, it is very helpul in troubleshooting and recovery.
It have standard paths.
Security and Permissions.
Organized file storage.
Separation of system and users data.

## Navigating the FileSystem

In, this we can discuss how can we change or manage our location in our terminal.
These are essentials command every user must know.

## ls

This command list files in our working directory.
     # ls -l
     
     This is a type of ls that list long format.
     If you use this command you can also check which is directory and which is file.
     Directory will have d in start and file have- then permissions written of file.
     
     # ls -a
     
     It shows all the hidden files.
     You will see the .(dot) in the starting of hidden files, In this way you can distinguish.
     
## pwd

It prints the present working directory.

## cd

This is used to change our directory.
cd stands for change directory.
terminal is case sensitive, so if you want to change directory write name same it is and capital words capital and small words small.

             # cd ..
             
             This is used to come one directory back.
             
## tree

It shows all the data in files with details in tree format.
If tree is not installed in your terminal just run command apt install tree.

## find

If we want to find and file we can use this command.
If you don't have idea of any file how to use it write file name and --help.
Here write find --help it will display all the methods to use find command.
Like find /home -name passwd it will find all the files who have passwd in their name.
This command mostly used in manual search.

## locate

The function of this command is same to find.
In this just write locate and file name it will automatically find all files of same name.
This command is mostly used in automatic search.

## which

It is also used to find but it gives us the location of commands.

### File Operations

These commands are used to perform all tha tasks related to files.

## cp

This command is used to copy a file.
        
        # cp -r
        
        Use this command if you want to copy the directory.
        
## mv

This command is used to move or rename the file.
If you write name that not exist in this way it rename the file.

## rm 

This is used to remove the file.
         
         # rm -r
         
         This is used to remove the directory.
         
## mkdir

This is used to create directory.

## mkdir -p

This command is used to make parent directory.

## rmdir

This is used to remove empty directory.
But this does'nt delete files who have data in it.

## touch / nano

These commands are used to make files.

## stat

This command is used to show the details of file.

### Viewing files

If you want to view or read the file following commands are use.

## cat

write cat and file name this is most used command to view the file.
